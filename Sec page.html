Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used
for describing
the presentation of a document written in a markup language
like HTML.
[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
CSS is designed to enable the separation of
presentation and content, including layout,
colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce
complexity and repetition in the structural content.
Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible
to present the same markup page in different styles for different
rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
(via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting
if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme
to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule
matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme
is predictable.
