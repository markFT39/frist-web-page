Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup
language for creating web pages and web applications.
With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript,
it forms a triad of cornerstone
technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
web server or from local storage and render
the documents into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web
page semantically and originally included
cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks
of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
images and other objects such as interactive
forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
paragraphs, lists,
links, quotes and other items. HTML
elements are delineated by tags,
written using angle brackets. Tags
such as directly
introduce content into the page. Other
tags such as <p> surround and provide information
about document text and may include other tags as
sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags,
but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language
such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content
of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout
of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer
of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use
of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[5]
