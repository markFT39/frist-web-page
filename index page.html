The World Wide Web (WWW), also called the Web,
is an information space where documents and other
web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links,
and accessible via the Internet.[1] English scientist
Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed
at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released
outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions
starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the
Internet in August 1991.
The World Wide Web has been central to
the development of the Information Age and
is the primary tool billions of people use to interact
on the Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text
documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML).[7] In addition to formatted text, web pages
may contain images, video, audio, and software components that
are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of
multimedia content.
Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between
web pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme,
a common domain name, or both, make up a website. Website
content can largely be provided by the publisher, or
interactively where users contribute content or the content
depends upon sthe users or their actions. Websites may be
mostly informative, primarily for entertainment, or largely
for commercial, governmental, or non-governmental organisational
dpurposes.
